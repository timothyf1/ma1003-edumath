Basic times tables
------------------

Below is a table that will help assist you with learning your times tables. 

At this level you should aim to learn up to your twelve times tables, knowing these off by heart will come in handy when moving onto more advanced maths.

Example of how to use table: 

What is 5 times 7? First go along until you reach 5, then go down until you’re on the 7th row, the answer should be 35.

+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|  x  |   1 |   2 |   3 |   4 |   5 |   6 |   7 |   8 |   9 |  10 |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|   1 |   1 |   2 |   3 |   4 |   5 |   6 |   7 |   8 |   9 |  10 |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|   2 |   2 |   4 |   6 |   8 |  10 |  12 |  14 |  16 |  18 |  20 |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|   3 |   3 |   6 |   9 |  12 |  15 |  18 |  21 |  24 |  27 |  30 |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|   4 |   4 |   8 |  12 |  16 |  20 |  24 |  28 |  32 |  36 |  40 |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|   5 |   5 |  10 |  15 |  20 |  25 |  30 |  35 |  40 |  45 |  50 |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|   6 |   6 |  12 |  18 |  24 |  30 |  36 |  42 |  48 |  54 |  60 |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|   7 |   7 |  14 |  21 |  28 |  35 |  42 |  49 |  56 |  63 |  70 |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|   8 |   8 |  16 |  24 |  32 |  40 |  48 |  56 |  64 |  72 |  80 |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|   9 |   9 |  18 |  27 |  36 |  45 |  54 |  63 |  72 |  81 |  90 |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|  10 |  10 |  20 |  30 |  40 |  50 |  60 |  70 |  80 |  90 | 100 |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

Long multiplication
-------------------

There are two main methods for long multiplication, the traditional method and box method, both are explained below, use which ever suits you best.

Traditional method:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Is where you multiply by the tens and units separately then add them together.

For example:

148 x 57, first we multiply 148 by 7 units: 

148

x 57

____

**1036**

Next we want to multiply 148 by 50, this is the same as 148 times 5 times ten.

148

x 57

____

1036

**7400**

Finally we add the two answers together.

148

x 57

_____

1036

7400

_____

8436

To find: 148 x 57 = 8436

Box method:
~~~~~~~~~~~

This method is where we split each number into parts (hundreds, tens, units).

To calculate 148 x 57;

We split 148 into 100, 40 and 8,

57 into 50 and 7.

We then put these numbers into a box, as shown below to calculate the answer:

+-------+------+------+-----+
| Times |  100 |   40 |   8 |
+-------+------+------+-----+
|    50 | 5000 | 2000 | 400 |
+-------+------+------+-----+
|     7 |  700 |  280 |  56 |
+-------+------+------+-----+

We have worked out 50 x 100, 50 x 40, 50 x 8, 7 x 100, 7 x 40 and 7 x 8.

When this has all been done, you have to write out all the answers and add them together:

5000

2000

400

700

280

56

Long division
-------------

There are two main methods to do long division, the traditional method and repeated subtraction also known as the chunking method. As with long multiplication, you can use which ever method suits you the best.

Traditional method:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This method is similar to short division however we write the remainder underneath rather than at the top each time.

Example: Divide 748 by 51;

First create a bus shelter like below.

.. image:: /images/MultiDiv1.png

Next we work out 74 divided by 51 and write the answer about the tens.

1 x 51 = 51, so we write this under 74.

Subtract 51 from 74 to get the remainder.

.. image:: /images/MultiDiv2.png

We now bring the next digit down and write it at the end of 23.

.. image:: /images/MultiDiv3.png

We now work out 238 divided by 51, and write the answer above the 8.

51 is roughly 50 and 4 × 50 = 200. You can work out 51 × 4 = 204 separately.

We write 204 underneath the 238 and subtract to find the remainder. 

There are no more digits to bring down, so we have our answer:

.. image:: /images/MultiDiv4.png

Repeated subtraction (chunking):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To calculate 748 divided by 51, we keep subtracting multiples of 51 until we cannot take any more away. 

We keep a note of how many times we have taken 51 away, leaving us with an answer.

We can begin by working out two easy sums. 

10 × 51 = 510

2 × 51 = 102

We have 748, so we are able to subtract 510 from this. We write 10 × 51 on the side.

.. image:: /images/MultiDiv5.png

This leaves 238, so we cannot subtract 510 again.

But we can subtract 102, so we write 2 x 51 on the side.

.. image:: /images/MultiDiv6.png

This leaves us with 136, so we can subtract another 102, writing 2 × 51 on the side:

.. image:: /images/MultiDiv7.png

This leaves 34. We have reached the end now as no more lots of 51 can be subtracted. 

We now add up how many lots of 51 we took away 10 + 2 + 2 = 14, so our answer is: 14 remainder 34.
