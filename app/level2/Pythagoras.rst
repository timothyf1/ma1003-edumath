Pythagoras
----------
Finding one side of the triangle when you know the other two sides.

Look at the diagrams below, what do you see in common?

In any right-angled triangle, the square of the longest side is the squares of the other two sides.

This formula can be written as :math:'a^2 + b^2 = c^2'

.. math::

   (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

   
Where the c is the longest side.

This is the Pythagoras Theorem.

To find out the third side of a right-angled triangle given that you know the other two sides, you can find the third like this:

#.	square (multiply by itself) the lengths you know
#.	add or subtract them
#.	find the square root

For these questions you will need to use the  button on your calculator.

For example:
 
.. image:: /images/Pythagoras3.png

#. Square the lengths you know: 82 = 64, 62 = 36
#. To find the longest side, add them together 82 + 62 
#. Square root of 100 = 10.

Here are some examples for you to try:

*Hint* If you are already given the hypotenuse (longest side) then subtract from it.

Your answers should be: 

Triangle 1

#. Square the lengths you know: 132 = 169, 52 = 25.
#. You know the longest side, so subtract the shorter side from the longest 169 â€“ 25 = 144
#. Square root of 144 = 12

Triangle 2

#. Square the lengths you know: 102 = 100, 72 = 49.
#. To find the longest side, add them together 100 + 49 = 149
#. Square root of 149 =
