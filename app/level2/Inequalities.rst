Inequalities
============

Symbols: greater than, less than, equal to
------------------------------------------

In an inequality, two expressions are joined by a relation symbol.

Below is a table showing relation symbols and their meanings;

+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Symbol | Meaning                                                     |
+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| <      | less than, so 2 < 5 is true                                 |
+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| >      | more than, so 6 > 3 is true                                 |
+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| ≤      | is less than or equal to so 2 ≤ 5 is true and so is 2 ≤ 2.  |
+--------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| ≥      | is more than or equal to so 6 ≥ 4 is true, and so is 6 ≥ 6. |

Solving inequalities
--------------------

An inequality such as 4x - 6 < 12 is similar to the equation 4x - 6 = 12. 

However, this time we are looking for numbers which if you multiply by 4, then subtract 6, you get an answer of less than 12.

There are lots of numbers for which this is true, so our answer is not a number, but a range of numbers.

We solve these inequalities just like simple equations: what you do to one side, you must do to the other.

Example:

Solve the inequality 2x + 4 > 8x - 2x

Step 1: Get x's on the same side and numbers on the same side;

4 + 2 > 8x - 2x

Step 2: Simplify;

6 > 6x

Step 3: Divide both sides by the number in front of x;

1 > x

Solving double inequalities
---------------------------
Sometimes you are given a 'double' inequality to solve. 

In this case, you just do the same thing to all three parts.

Example

Solve: -4 < 2x - 6 < 12

Step 1: Cancel out one of the numbers by adding or subtracting that number in all three parts of the inequality.

Here we can add 6 to all the parts; 2 < 2x < 18

Step 2: Divide all three parts by the number in front of the x term.

Here we can divide all the parts by 2; 1 < x < 9

Inequalities and graphs
-----------------------

Number lines
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inequalities can also be shown on a number line.

Using an open circle for < and >, and a solid circle for =.

Example

Solve 2 < 3x + 5 ≤ 17, and show the solution on a number line.

2 < 3x + 5 ≤ 17

-3 < 3x ≤ 12

-1 < x ≤ 4

Regions on a graph
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Another way to show inequalities is by shading regions on a graph.

Example

On a graph, show the region where:-

x ≤ 1 and y ≤ 3.

Draw on the lines x = 1 and y = 3.

The possible values of x and y are shown by the area between these two lines.
