Percentages
===========

In general, “Percent” means ‘out of 100’. If 90 per cent of the population owns a mobile phone, this means 90 out of every 100 people have one. The symbol “%” means per cent.

Finding Percentages
-------------------

A percentage is a fraction of 100.

30% is written as 30/100

30% as a decimal is written as 0.3

**Example 1:**

Find 40% of £50.

First write 40% as a fraction = 40% = 40/100 = 4/10 = 2/5

Now multiply by the quantity provided:

2/5 x 50 = £20.

**Example 2:**

Sarah is buying a pair of jeans. The original price was £75, but there is a discount of 30%. How much will the discount be?

Discount = 30% of 75

= 30/100 x 75

0.3 x 75

= £22.50

Note that if the question asked for the discount price, you would subtract the discount from the original price: £75 - £22.50 = £52.50

**Example 3:**

A car costs £9,999.90 before VAT (value added tax). Work out the cost of the VAT if it is charged at 20%.

VAT = 20% of £9,999.90

= 20/100 x 9,999.90

= 1,999.98

Since the answer is a price, it must be rounded to two decimal places. 

The answer is £1,999.98

Simple Interest
---------------

Simple interest is the concept that the amount of money borrowed remains fixed.

For example £400 is borrow for 3 years at an interest rate of 5% per annum

Interest for one year = 5% of £400

= (5/100 )  x 400

= £20.

Interest for three years = £20 x 3 = £60

You can write this in a formula:

**Interest = P x R x T**

* P is the amount borrowed
* R is the rate of interest per year
* T is the time in years.

Profit and Loss
---------------

People often buy something at one price, and sell it on for another - eg, when they are selling things at a car boot sale.

If the selling price is greater than the buying price, a profit is made.

If the selling price is less than the buying price, there is a loss.

**Example 1:**

Bob is dealing in electrical goods. He buys a radio for £45 and sells if for £63. What is his percentage profit?

Here the cost price is £45 and the selling price is £63.

The profit is £63 - £45 = £18.

To calculate the percentage profit you have to find what the profit is as a percentage of the original price. So divide the profit by the original price and multiply by 100.

18 ÷ 45 x 100 = 40%
