Transformations 
===============
Transforming an object means changing its appearance. There are many ways to do this, but we are going to concentrate on just 3 of them. Enlarging, reflecting and translating.

In each of these sections, we refer to the original shape as the object and the transformed shape as the image.

Translation
-----------

If we *translate* an object, we move it up or down or from side to side. But we do not change its shape, size or direction.

For example, our yellow triangle is the object and the other 3 triangles are the images.

Q is a translation of triangle ABC. Triangle has been translated 3 squares to the right and 2 squares up.

P is not a translation of triangle ABC because the object and its image are facing in opposite directions.

R is not a translation of triangle ABC because the object and its image have different side lengths. They are different shapes.

Using vectors to describe translations

In this graph, the object is the red line from A to B, and the image is the green line from A to B.

We write directions in the vector form of. 

* The top number – left/right 
* The bottom number – up/down 
* A move downwards or left is indicated by the – sign. 

Reflection
----------

When an object is transformed by a reflection, the object and its image are always the same perpendicular distance from the mirror line. 

In this example, A and A’ are the same perpendicular distance from the mirror line, as are B and B’ and C and C’.

Therefore we can say the object ABC has been reflected in the mirror line to give image A’B’C’.

Reflecting triangles into x and y axes
The object is triangle ABC.

.. image:: /images/Transformations4.png

Reflection in x = -1

.. image:: /images/Transformations5.png

Reflection in y = 1

.. image:: /images/Transformations6.png

Reflection in y = x

.. image:: /images/Transformations7.png

Reflection in y = -x

Enlargement
-----------

When working out enlargements, you will need to know the scale factor and centre of enlargement.

* The scale factor tells us by how much the object has been enlarged. 
* The centre of enlargement tells us where the enlargement is being measured from. 

For example:

.. image:: /images/Transformations9.png

P'Q' = 3 × PQ
Q'R' = 3 × QR
P'R' = 3 × PR

Therefore we see that the transformation is an enlargement with scale factor 3.

Enlarging using a centre of enlargement

For example, the green triangle is the object and the orange outlined triangle is the image.

.. image:: /images/Transformations10.png

To enlarge an object, scale factor 3.

This method is identical to the previous one, but

OA' = 3 × OA 

OB' = 3 × OB 

OC' = 3 × OC
