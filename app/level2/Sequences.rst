Sequences
=========

Recognising Sequences
---------------------

A sequence is a list of numbers. The numbers are called the terms of the sequence.

There are many well-known sequences of numbers which you should be able to recognise.

Even numbers

2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12...

Odd numbers

1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11...

Square numbers

1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64...

Cube numbers

1, 8, 27, 64, 125...

Powers of 2

2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64...


Powers of 10

10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000, 1,000,000...

Triangle numbers

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28...

Linear Sequences
----------------

1, 4, 7, 10 is a sequence starting with 1.

You get the next term by adding 3 to the previous term.

You are often asked to find a formula for the nth term.

As the common difference is 3, try 3n.

When n = 1, 3n = 3, and we subtract 2 to make the first term correct.

So the nth term = 3n - 2

This method will always work for sequences where the difference between terms stays the same.

Example:
~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    Find the nth term in the sequences 1, 5, 9, 13

    The difference between each term is 4.

    This lets you work out the first bit of the formula. The formula for this sequence is 4n.

    Now look at each term.

    When n=1, 4n = 4.

    We therefore have to subtract 3 to get the first correct term.

    The formula for the sequence is 4n - 3.

Quadratic Sequences
-------------------
A quadratic sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the second differences between each consecutive term differ by the same amount, called a common second difference.

Example 1:
~~~~~~~~~~

If you use the formula n2 + n to make a sequence, it means that:

When n = 1 you get 12 + 1 = 2

When n = 2 you get 22 + 2 = 6

When n = 3 you get 32 + 3 = 12

When n = 4 you get 42 + 4 = 20

- giving the sequence 2, 6, 12, 20.

Here, the differences between terms are not constant, but there is still a pattern.

- The first differences increase by 2 each time

- The second increases by 2

When the second difference is constant, you have a quadratic sequence - ie, there is an n2 term.
