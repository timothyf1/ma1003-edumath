Symmetry
========

Reflection Symmetry
-------------------

A Shape if symmetrical if both sides of it are the same when a mirror line is drawn.

For example, this shape is symmetrical. It has a reflection symmetry and a mirror line.

However some shapes have more than one line of symmetry.

For example, this square has 4 lines of symmetry.

Rotation Symmetry
-----------------

The number of different ways in which the tracing fits is the **order of rotation symmetry**.

In order to determine the order of rotation symmetry it is best to:

#. Trace the outline of the shape (using tracing paper)
#. Find the middle point of the shape, put your pencil on it and swivel the tracing paper around to see how many repetitions of symmetry there are.

For example, this shape has rotational symmetry of 4 as it fits itself 4 times.

If a shape will only fit itself in one way, it has **no rotation symmetry**. Because it fits in only one way, it has rotation symmetry of order 1
