Volume and Surface Area
=======================

Surface Area
------------

This is a net of a cube. To work out a surface area, dimensions are added to either a 3D object or a net of a shape. The cube has 6 faces, each a square. We can find the area of each square fairly easily. 

If we work out the total area for the 6 faces we will have worked out the **Surface Area**

The surface area in this case is easy. Find the area of one face and multiply it by 6.

Area of a square = 5 x 5 = 25cm2 

Surface Area = 25 x 6 = 150cm2

This net is a cuboid. To work out the surface area, again dimensions are added. However, unlike the previous example not all the dimensions are the same and are not square.

Take each square individually:

Top: 6 x 4 = 24cm2

Bottom: 6 x 4 = 24cm2

Left: 3 x 4 = 12cm2

Right: 3 x 4 =12cm2

Back: 6 x 3 = 18cm2

Front: 6 x 3 = 18cm2

Add together 

Total Surface Area = 108cm2

Surface Area of Prisms
----------------------

This is the net of a triangular prism. We can easily work out the surface area

Remember the area of a triangle is:

A = 0.5 base x height

Triangle 1 = 0.5 (5 x 6 ) = 15cm2

Triangle 2 = 0.5 (5 x 6 ) = 15cm2

Panel 1 = 8 x 6.5 = 52cm2

Panel 2 = 8 x 5 = 40cm2

Panel 3 = 8 x 6.5 = 52cm2

Total Surface Area = 174cm2

As an exercise you may want to practice drawing the nets to these:

Surface Area of Cylinders 
-------------------------

This is a net of a cylinder. It is made up of two identical circles and a rectangle. Remember the formula give for the area of a circle?

Area of one circle = πr2 = π x 3 x 3

= 28.3cm2

Area of rectangle = length x width

The width is the circumference of the circle

= π x d

= π x 6

= 18.8cm2

Area of rectangle = 8 x 18.8 

= 150cm2 (to the nearest cm2)

Total Surface Area = 2 circles and rectangle

= 2 x 28.3cm2 + 150cm2

= 207cm2
