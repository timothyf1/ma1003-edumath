Roots and Powers 
================

Squares, cubes and their roots
------------------------------

**Squaring a number**

4² means '4 squared', or 4 x 4.

The small 2 is a power. It tells us how many times we multiply 4 by itself.

Similarly 8² means '8 squared', or 8 x 8.

And 10² means '10 squared', or 10 x 10.

So, 12 = 1 x 1 = 1

2² = 2 x 2 = 4	

3² = 3 x 3 = 9

4² = 4 x 4 = 16

5² = 5 x 5 = 25

These are shown along the diagonal of the multiplication table used previously in this section, these numbers are known as square numbers.

**Square roots**

The opposite of a square number is a square root.

This symbol    means square root.

So, in fact,   = 2 or -2. And   = 5 or -5.

Every positive number has two square roots.

**Cubing a number**

2 x 2 x 2 means '2 cubed', and is written as 2³.

1³ = 1 x 1 x 1 = 1

2³ = 2 x 2 x 2 = 8

3³ = 3 x 3 x 3 = 27

4³ = 4 x 4 x 4 = 64

5³ = 5 x 5 x 5 = 125

These are known as cube numbers.

**Cube roots**

The opposite of a cube number is a cube root. 

This symbol   means cube root.

So   is 2 and   is 3.

Each number only has one cube root.

Rules of indices
----------------

You can perform operations on numbers that have been squared, cubed or raised to higher powers. There are three rules to remember for multiplying, dividing, and the power of a power.

**Multiplying**

When multiplying add the powers.

2³ × 2^4 = (2 × 2 × 2) × (2 × 2 × 2 × 2)

= 2^7

**Dividing**

When dividing subtract the powers.

2^5 ÷ 2^2 =   = 2 × 2 × 2 (Cancelling two of the 2s)

= 2^3

**The power of a power**

When taking the power of a number already raised to a power, multiply the powers.

For example this is how to find the square of 23.

square of 23 = (23)2 = (2 × 2 × 2) × (2 × 2 × 2) = 26
